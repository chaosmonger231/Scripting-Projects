The Shell Script in this repo is a crude attempt of making a file analyzer. This was created for scripting class (project 1) but it was created with CTF/Forensics in mind. The repo also included a zip file called "USB Contents". This acts as a fake USB that should contain tens and thousands of files with varying types. However, in this case, there are only a few provided ones.
